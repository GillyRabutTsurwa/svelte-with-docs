# Reactive Statements
- just like reactive declarations, but instead of assigning values, we can also write code with the dependent value as the subject
- so for example, in our last example in the previous branch, we made a squared reactive variable which was dependent on ```count``` which updated everytime ```count``` was changed
- this time, we can simply ```console.log(count)```, for example, everytime ```count``` changes. we can obviously do much more
